# UPI Transaction Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data to uncover insights into payment trends, user behavior, and system efficiency. Using a combination of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques, the project provides valuable analytics on transaction volumes, transaction types, user demographics, and time-based trends.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the transaction dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns in transaction frequency, value, and user preferences using statistical and visual methods.
Transaction Insights: Analyzed peak transaction times, popular transaction types, and regional usage trends.
Data Visualization: Utilized Power BI (or Matplotlib/Seaborn for Python) to create interactive dashboards or static visual reports for better interpretation.
Summary Reports: Generated reports highlighting key performance indicators such as the total number of transactions, average transaction value, and growth patterns over time.
