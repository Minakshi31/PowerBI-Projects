In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize the financial and demographic data of American Bank's customers. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of customer segments, financial behaviors, and trends across different states and job classifications.

# Key Objectives:

Demographic Segmentation: Categorized customers based on gender, age, education, and marital status to understand their distribution and characteristics.
Financial Insights: Analyzed key financial metrics such as total customer balances, loan statuses, and homeownership trends.
Job Classification Analysis: Segmented customers by their job type (white-collar, blue-collar, others) to identify patterns in income, loan defaults, and financial health.
State-Level Analysis: Visualized customer distribution and behavior across California, Nevada, and Oregon.
Loan Default Analysis: Identified the number of loan defaulters and analyzed their correlation with other factors such as job classification and education level.

# Tools & Techniques:
Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Power Query for data transformation and feature engineering.
Advanced filtering and slicers to allow interactive data exploration by state, job classification, and contact method.
This analysis provided actionable insights into customer segments, helping the bank better understand its clientele and financial risk factors.
